Description: 
   Almost all survey adjustments face a practical data limitation: the joint population 
   distributions of variables we adjust on (such as race, partisanship, and geography) 
   are limited. There is a long tradition of statistical and applied work that can be 
   grouped under the umbrella of synthetic population imputation that seeks to expand 
   the set of available interactions to poststratify on. 
   This set of functions is currently used to interface with the ccesMRPprep package
   (www.github.com/kuriwaki/ccesMRPprep).
   Model fitting and visualization of MRP itself is handled elsewhere. This package
   is focused on the preparation to get there.
